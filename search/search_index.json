For supported resources, Vantage will give you a running log of what changes were made to that resource which you can use for record purposes and governance. When you upgrade your account to the business tier, you'll have this feature available to you for supported services on the \"Audit Log\" tab. Example use-cases: IAM Role History : Be able to see what users made what changes to certain roles. Container Service Changes : See what changes to your ECS & Fargate services by what users (or other AWS services such as CodeDeploy) [Soon] Create views from audit logs : Be able to see what users are logging into the console for security posture.","title":"Audit Log"},{"location":"connecting/","text":"Setup Connecting Your AWS Account Vantage understands security concerns and aims to provide as secure of a connection as possible with your AWS accounts. Vantage uses a mechanism called a \"Cross Account IAM Role\" to interact with services in your AWS account. AWS has publicly documented this method and officially recommends it as the preferred method of doing any cross account interactions on AWS. Numerous internal AWS services and systems also leverage this method. This means that Vantage never needs access credentials, account logins or passwords. Note that everyone who works at Vantage has previously worked in public cloud infrastructure including companies like AWS, DigitalOcean, Github, Akamai and Cloudflare and we are taking best practices learned at those companies into consideration when building Vantage. Read Only by Default When you create a Cross Account IAM Role using the provided CloudFormation template you are giving Vantage various permissions . All of the permissions by default are ReadOnly. The list of permissions was created by using the official AWS ReadOnly policy and removing some of the permissions AWS includes in that list in order to prevent Vantage from seeing information like reading from S3 Buckets and reading from databases. Vantage only collects metadata about your infrastructure and never even attempts to read sensitive information from the underlying services. Our CloudFormation template is public and you may audit the list of permissions here . Opting into Write Actions Vantage currently supports a limited subset of write, update and delete actions. When you attempt to perform these actions with Vantage, Vantage will determine what IAM permissions it needs to complete those actions and request them accordingly. It will always be at your discretion to opt into these actions. You may also choose to never use Vantage for write actions. Connecting Multiple AWS Accounts Vantage allows you to connect multiple AWS accounts. We advise that you connect your master AWS account first. By default, we require you to start with one AWS account and ensure it properly connected. Upon connecting a master AWS account, Vantage will profile for all member accounts present in the organization. Vantage will be able to show you accrued costs from all member accounts in the organization as well as active resources that are present in that master AWS account . In the event that you have multiple member accounts and want to view Active Resources present in those accounts, Vantage will offer you the ability to run something called a CloudFormation StackSet that will create one role per AWS member account. You're also welcome to skip this step and add/remove AWS accounts from your account settings whenever you see fit.","title":"Connecting Your Account"},{"location":"connecting/#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"connecting/#connecting-your-aws-account","text":"Vantage understands security concerns and aims to provide as secure of a connection as possible with your AWS accounts.

By default, Vantage provides you with a Cost Report named \"All Resources\" that will show you all costs across all AWS member accounts, regions, services and tags. You can create as many Cost Reports as you'd like to filter your costs by any of the aforementioned dimensions. Many customers typically setup one Cost Report per AWS tag that their team has defined to see costs for certain components of their application. Below is an example of what a Cost Report will look like after you have connected your account. Filtering Cost Reports Cost Reports allow you to see your costs grouped by AWS Service in descending order of accrued costs. By clicking AWS Service rows in the table below, the graph will update with just costs for that specific AWS Service. You may also click the AWS Service name link to see subcategory costs which is described in the next section. AWS Service Subcategory Costs Each AWS Service typically has multiple underlying subcategory costs. For example, in the main cost report table view you'll see all of your S3 Costs in aggregate. However, S3 charges on a number of different subcategories like the amount of storage you've used, the amount of egress traffic for retrieving S3 Objects and for the actual HTTP requests you make to query for S3 Objects. By clicking an AWS service name from the main Cost Report table, you can see a full breakdown of all subcategory costs that comprise that main AWS service cost. Below is an example of subcategory costs for EC2-Other which includes subcategory costs for EBS Volumes, data transfer and more. When supported and resources are present, Vantage will also show you the Active Resources contributing to these subcategory costs.","title":"Cost Reports"},{"location":"cost_reports/#filtering-cost-reports","text":"Cost Reports allow you to see your costs grouped by AWS Service in descending order of accrued costs.

These forecasts are based off of your account's actual cost data and produced from a Vantage-developed machine learning model that is trained anonymously from all Vantage customers to be as accurate as possible. Vantage gives a range of an upper-expected-band and a lower-expected-band with a median forecast that is the middle of these two ranges. This forecast is updated daily as new cost data arrives. Below is a picture of an example Cost Forecast. AWS Service Forecasts In addition to seeing forecasts in aggregate for Cost Reports, you can also see a per AWS service cost forecast by clicking the rows in the table below. This will show you forecasts for each individual AWS service. Forecast Generation Forecasts take some time to generate - typically within 10 minutes but is dependent on the amount of data composing a Cost Report. If you don't see a forecast being generated temporarily after creating your account or creating a new Cost Report check back in after about 10-15 minutes and it should appear. Forecasts for Member Accounts, Tags, or Regions Forecasts are generated for every Cost Report . As a result, if you would like to see a forecast for a specific member account, tag or region you can simply create a Cost Report with the dimensions you desire and a forecast will be generated accordingly.","title":"Forecasting"},{"location":"forecasting/#aws-service-forecasts","text":"In addition to seeing forecasts in aggregate for Cost Reports, you can also see a per AWS service cost forecast by clicking the rows in the table below.

Without any action necessary by you, Vantage will determine what resources have been deleted, added and changed and represent them in the Vantage console accordingly. We are sensitive to our impact on AWS API limits and have done considerable work on minimizing the amount of API requests we make to limit impact. That being said, we haven't had a single user mention concerns with API calls we make. In the navigation bar at the top of the Vantage console you'll see a refresh icon available to you. When you hover over that refresh icon, Vantage will inform you when the time a sync took place. Manual Syncing In the event that you're making changes to your infrastructure, it's very common that you'll need to refresh the state with Vantage prior to the one hour interval taking place. To issue a manual account sync, you simply need to click the refresh icon in the top right of the navigation bar. The refresh icon will begin rotating signalling that the sync is in progress. When the sync is complete, the icon will stop rotating. You may need to refresh the page you're currently on to get the latest information after the sync has occured. When you issue a sync, Vantage will do a global inspection across all AWS regions and services and perform the following: Add new AWS resources in the Vantage console that are newly added. Remove any references to out of date or deleted resources. Update all attributes with existing resources that have been changed.

Active Resources are meant to give you a simple way for seeing what active resources are present in your AWS account. Note that we can only show active resources for accounts for which there is a connected IAM Role -- but you can connect as many member accounts as you'd like to see resources present from them. Active Resource Pricing Vantage maintains an ever-growing and always-updating AWS pricing database. As Vantage finds active resources, it will find the corresponding rate for the resource to show you an approximate run-rate cost. For things like EC2 Instances, we will profile for the instance type being used, what region its in and apply the proper rate for its lifecycle (on-demand, spot, etc). We also show an approximate monthly run-rate which extrapolates this hourly rate out for the given month. Actively being worked on in our roadmap is also showing actual accrued costs per AWS Resource so not only will you see a rough run-rate but you'll be able to see actual accrued costs per AWS resource soon as well. Active Resources and Syncing Vantage periodically syncs your account and you may also manually issue a sync from the top navigation bar. Whenever a sync occurs, Vantage will automatically determine what Active Resources are present globally across all supported services and represent them accordingly in the Vantage console. If you make an immediate change to your infrastructure and want to see its impact in Vantage simply issue a sync manually and the changes will be picked up accordingly.

When your Vantage account is created you are assigned a \"Default\" workspace but you have the ability to create multiple workspaces. Each workspace is a logical grouping of AWS accounts and has its own respective set of views. There are two main use-cases we see for customers leveraging workspaces on Vantage. Grouping resources together across AWS accounts : One customer on AWS sometimes has multiple AWS accounts for the same company. Vantage customers will use a single workspace to group multiple AWS accounts together to view all resources in the same console and views. Context Switching Between AWS Accounts : Some customers (such as indepedendent contractors) will create a workspace per customer of theirs. This allows them to quickly do discovery of the resources in that AWS account and level set for assisting those customers and context switch between accounts quickly while keeping respective views and resources separate. When you have more than one workspace in your Vantage account a workspace menu will appear in your navigation menu for you to switch between workspaces. Workspaces are also represented on your account page for you to view, add AWS accounts to and delete whenever you'd like.
