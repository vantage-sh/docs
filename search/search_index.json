For supported resources, Vantage will give you a running log of what changes were made to that resource which you can use for record purposes and governance. When you upgrade your account to the business tier, you'll have this feature available to you for supported services on the \"Audit Log\" tab. Example use-cases: IAM Role History : Be able to see what users made what changes to certain roles. Container Service Changes : See what changes to your ECS & Fargate services by what users (or other AWS services such as CodeDeploy) [Soon] Create views from audit logs : Be able to see what users are logging into the console for security posture.","title":"Audit Log"},{"location":"connecting/","text":"Setup Connecting Your AWS Account Vantage understands security concerns and aims to provide as secure of a connection as possible with your AWS accounts. Vantage uses a mechanism called a \"Cross Account IAM Role\" to interact with services in your AWS account. AWS has publicly documented this method and officially recommends it as the preferred method of doing any cross account interactions on AWS. Numerous internal AWS services and systems also leverage this method. This means that Vantage never needs access credentials, account logins or passwords. Read Only by Default When you create a Cross Account IAM Role using the provided CloudFormation template you are giving Vantage various permissions. All of the permissions by default are ReadOnly. The list of permissions was created by using the official AWS ReadOnly policy and removing some of the permissions AWS includes in that list in order to prevent Vantage from seeing information like reading from S3 Buckets and reading from databases. Vantage only collects metadata about your infrastructure and never even attempts to read sensitive information from the underlying services. Our CloudFormation template is public and you may audit the list of permissions here . Opting into Write Actions Vantage currently supports a limited subset of write, update and delete actions. When you attempt to perform these actions with Vantage, Vantage will determine what IAM permissions it needs to complete those actions and request them accordingly. It will always be at your discretion to opt into these actions. You may also choose to never use Vantage for write actions. Connecting Multiple AWS Accounts Vantage allows you to connect multiple AWS accounts. By default, we require you to start with one AWS account and ensure it properly connected. Once you have done that, you can navigate to your account settings page to add additional AWS accounts. Please note that there are restrictions on the number of AWS accounts you can add based upon your tier. To see those limits please visit our pricing page","title":"Connecting Your Account"},{"location":"connecting/#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"connecting/#connecting-your-aws-account","text":"Vantage understands security concerns and aims to provide as secure of a connection as possible with your AWS accounts.

Without any action necessary by you, Vantage will determine what resources have been deleted, added and changed and represent them in the Vantage console accordingly. We are sensitive to our impact on AWS API limits and have done considerable work on minimizing the amount of API requests we make to limit impact. That being said, we haven't had a single user mention concerns with API calls we make. In the navigation bar at the top of the Vantage console you'll see a refresh icon available to you. When you hover over that refresh icon, Vantage will inform you when the time a sync took place. Manual Syncing In the event that you're making changes to your infrastructure, it's very common that you'll need to refresh the state with Vantage prior to the one hour interval taking place. To issue a manual account sync, you simply need to click the refresh icon in the top right of the navigation bar. The refresh icon will begin rotating signalling that the sync is in progress. When the sync is complete, the icon will stop rotating. You may need to refresh the page you're currently on to get the latest information after the sync has occured. When you issue a sync, Vantage will do a global inspection across all AWS regions and services and perform the following: Add new AWS resources in the Vantage console that are newly added. Remove any references to out of date or deleted resources. Update all attributes with existing resources that have been changed. Syncs usually take anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds depending on the size and complexity of your AWS account and we're working on tools Coming Soon: Resource-Level Syncs Sometimes you don't need to issue a global sync when you're just looking at a single resource that may have changed.

When you connect your AWS account, Vantage will automatically profile your account and create three sets of views for you: Service Views : You'll get a view for each service you use (EC2 instances, S3 Buckets, etc.) Tagged Views : If you use tags on AWS, Vantage will group resources together across different services and regions where it sees \"significant\" groups of AWS resources. Custom Views : Vantage will give you your first \"custom view\" named All Resources that allows you to see all resources in your AWS account. You can think of views as being like SQL queries for your infrastructure and you're free to create your own views. View Templates Every user on Vantage has access to a menu of View templates. Below is a screenshot of the view template menu. Above: Example of View Templates View templates are popular views that customers have requested. You're free to select from these view templates to add to your Vantage account or create your own views. Creating Custom Views Vantage gives you the ability to create your own custom views. When you click \"Create View\" and then \"Custom View\" you'll arrive at the view creation page . Attribute conditions On this page you'll be able to see all of the AWS services you use and a list of attributes you can optionally choose to filter on. We currently only support a limited support of attributes for each service but if you need additional attributes exposed, please contact support@vantage.sh and there is a possibility we can expose the attribute for you within a few days. Currently, conditions have the following operators available: equals : For finding all AWS resources with an exact match on a certain attribute. For example, show me all EC2 instances where the region is us-east-1. contains : For finding all AWS resources with a substring match on a certain attribute. For example, show me all EC2 instances where the name contains 'production'. does not contain : For finding all AWS resources which do not contain a certain string. For example, show me all IAM roles that do not contain 'AWSServiceRoleFor' Multiple AWS services in the same view Vantage supports grouping AWS resources together across multiple services. To do this, simply click the \"New Condition Set\" and select the additional AWS service you'd like to include. Editting Views You may edit any view whenever you like. The only exception is you can not edit Vantage-managed views, which have custom logic in place to find resources. To edit a view: Click into the view page. Click the \"...\" in the top right of the page. Click \"Edit View\" Make any changes you'd like Save the view. Deleting Views You may delete any view whenever you like. To delete a view: Click into the view page. Click the \"...\" in the top right of the page. Click \"Delete View\" Note that deleting a view on Vantage does not impact any of your AWS infrastructure. It merely removes that view from your Vantage console and no resources are impacted. Recommends Views to Vantage Vantage is always looking for views to include in our view template menu.

When your Vantage account is created you are assigned a \"Default\" workspace but you have the ability to create multiple workspaces. Each workspace is a logical grouping of AWS accounts and has its own respective set of views. There are two main use-cases we see for customers leveraging workspaces on Vantage. Grouping resources together across AWS accounts : One customer on AWS sometimes has multiple AWS accounts for the same company. Vantage customers will use a single workspace to group multiple AWS accounts together to view all resources in the same console and views. Context Switching Between AWS Accounts : Some customers (such as indepedendent contractors) will create a workspace per customer of theirs. This allows them to quickly do discovery of the resources in that AWS account and level set for assisting those customers and context switch between accounts quickly while keeping respective views and resources separate. When you have more than one workspace in your Vantage account a workspace menu will appear in your navigation menu for you to switch between workspaces. Workspaces are also represented on your account page for you to view, add AWS accounts to and delete whenever you'd like. Please note the restrictions on AWS account limits per Vantage account on the pricing page .","title":"Workspaces"}]}
